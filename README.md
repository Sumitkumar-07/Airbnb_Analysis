## Project Objectives

This project aims to analyze Airbnb data using MongoDB Atlas, perform data cleaning and preparation, develop interactive geospatial visualizations, and create dynamic plots to gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends in the Airbnb marketplace.

### 1. Establish MongoDB Connection

- **Objective**: Establish a connection to MongoDB Atlas to efficiently retrieve the Airbnb dataset, ensuring seamless data retrieval for analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation

- **Objective**: Ensure accurate analysis by addressing issues such as missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions in the dataset.

### 3. Interactive Web Application

- **Objective**: Develop a Streamlit web application that offers interactive maps to showcase the distribution of Airbnb listings. Users will have the ability to explore various factors such as prices, ratings, and other relevant data points.

### 4. Price Analysis and Visualization

- **Objective**: Conduct an in-depth price analysis, visualizing price variations based on factors such as location, property type, and seasonal trends. Dynamic plots and charts will be employed to enhance the understanding of pricing dynamics.

### 5. Availability Patterns

- **Objective**: Analyze and visualize availability patterns, including occupancy rates and demand fluctuations across seasons. These insights will provide valuable information for both hosts and guests.

### 6. Location-Based Insights

- **Objective**: Investigate location-based insights by extracting and visualizing data for specific regions or neighborhoods. This will help users understand the Airbnb landscape in different geographic areas.

### 7. Interactive Visualizations

- **Objective**: Create interactive visualizations that allow users to filter and drill down into the data, facilitating exploratory data analysis.

### 8. Comprehensive Dashboard

- **Objective**: Build a comprehensive dashboard using tools such as Tableau or Power BI. This dashboard will combine various visualizations to present key insights derived from the analysis, making it a valuable resource for decision-makers in the travel and hospitality industry.
